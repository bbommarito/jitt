A lightweight wrapper for Git that adds project-specific enhancements ‚Äî starting with support for Jira-aware commit workflows.

**jitt** stands for **"Jira + Git + Tiny Tooling"** ‚Äî the idea is to build small, targeted features that help integrate common workflows (like Jira ticket linking or commit hygiene) without introducing heavyweight dependencies or complex configuration.

---

## ‚ú® What it does

Right now, jitt:

- Passes any unknown commands straight through to Git
- Adds a basic `jitt jira init` command, which creates a `.jira` file in the current Git repo
- Avoids accidental `.jira` creation outside a Git repo
- Lays the foundation for smarter Jira integration (like enforcing ticket prefixes in commit messages)

---

## üîß Why build this?

I wanted something that feels like Git, behaves like Git, but can gently nudge teams (and myself) into better habits ‚Äî like associating commits with real tickets or ensuring clean logs. All without enforcing complex Git hooks or rewriting history.

And also? I wanted an excuse to learn Go.

---

## üß† Be gentle ‚Äî I‚Äôm new to Go!

This is one of my first projects in Go, and I‚Äôm learning as I build. So if you spot something odd or non-idiomatic, feel free to open an issue or PR ‚Äî just maybe... do it with a little kindness?

I'm here to learn, improve, and have fun along the way.

---

## üöß Roadmap

Planned features (each added carefully and test-first):

- ‚úÖ `jitt jira init` command
- ‚è≥ Enforce ticket key pattern in commits (e.g., `ABC-123: message`)
- ‚è≥ Add `jitt jira validate` for pre-commit hooks
- ‚è≥ Configurable Jira key prefixes
- ‚è≥ Optional project scaffolding (`.jira.json`, `.gitignore`, etc.)

## üì¶ Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
go install github.com/bbommarito/jitt@latest
```

### Development

For development, clone the repo and use the provided Makefile:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bbommarito/jitt.git
cd jitt

# Set up development environment
make dev-setup

# Build the binary
make build

# Run tests
make test

# See all available commands
make help
```

## üß™ Testing

This project uses [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo) for BDD-style testing with [Gomega](https://github.com/onsi/gomega) for assertions. We've migrated from Testify to provide better test organization and readability.

To run the tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with verbose output
go test -v ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run with race detection
go test -race ./...
```

Or use Ginkgo directly for even prettier output:

```bash
# Install Ginkgo CLI (optional)
go install github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2/ginkgo@latest

# Run with Ginkgo
ginkgo -r -v
```

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributions welcome

Whether you're a seasoned Gopher or just curious, feel free to suggest changes, report bugs, or discuss ideas. All voices welcome ‚Äî especially if you bring patience and a sense of humor.
